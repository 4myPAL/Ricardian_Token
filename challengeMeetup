[*]Anyone who offers goods and services for sale in the market is qualified to issue currency. [i]THE END OF MONEY AND THE FUTURE OF CIVILIZATION, by Thomas H. Greco, Jr., 2009[/i] 
[*]Buyers and sellers should be free to use any payment medium that is mutually agreeable to them, including the issuance and acceptance of their own currencies.
[*]Only the issuer of a currency should be obliged to accept it as payment, and must always accept it at face value (“at par”).
[*]There should be no forced circulation of any currency. Legal tender should obligate government only, and should not apply to transactions between private parties.
[*]Credit Coin is a contract backed by promises of future productivity, and in that sense, is no different than conventional bank credit, time-dollars or LETS systems. [i]DIGITAL COIN IN BRIEF, by Paul Grignon, 2009[/i]
[*]..., it is apparent that the buyer who issued the monetary instrument to the seller has made a commitment to the community that he, in his turn, will engage in business, i.e., will bid for money by offering his own goods and services in the open market.
